# Collapse of Nations

**Collapse of Nations** is a mod for [Hearts of Iron IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/). This mod expands and reshapes the geopolitical landscape of the modern world by introducing new mechanics, richer national histories, and deeper alternative history paths.

## 🌍 About the Mod

In an era of global uncertainty, alliances shift, new powers rise, and former empires can re-emerge from the ashes. **Collapse of Nations** aims to make the game more dynamic by:

- Redefining borders and adding historically plausible irredentist claims.
- Enriching the **world** with new regional conflicts to allow more flavourful historical and alt-historical outcomes.
- Adding **unique national focuses, decisions**, and **events** for ALL nations.
- Expanding **AI behavior** to better reflect ideological alignments and (un)realistic geopolitical goals.

## 🧠 Features

- ⚔️ Overhauled state layout and map changes for immersive empire-building.
- 📜 New deep lore for every region in historical and unhistorical depth.
- 🏛 Country-specific division names and military structure (WIP).

## 🗺️ Structure

- `localisation/english/` – Defines all cosmetic names (english).
- `map/` – Province, strategic region, and state layout changes.
